training<-read.csv('pml-training.csv')
testing<-read.csv('pml-testing.csv')
```

partitioning training data set for cross validation

```{r}
library(caret)
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=training$class,p=0.75,list=FALSE)
train<-training[inTrain,]
test<-training[-inTrain,]
```

building model on train data set by rpart

```{r}
modFit<-train(classe~.,method='rpart',data=train)

```

prediction based on model built

```{r}
predict(modFit,newdata=test)

```
